# Time
The Time class represents a 24-hour period of time. The inputs may include inaccurate data. As a result, if the time values are inaccurate, it modifies them. The value of the argument is then added to the current time. Any negative value is changed to zero, two times are desired to be compared, and the time object is printed in the standardized format.
